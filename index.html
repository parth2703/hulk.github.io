<span>Friends and Foes</span> <br>
 Not long after Hulk was baited into a trap by the Asgardian trickster, Loki, into destroying a <BR> train trestle. This would lead to the first instance where Hulk became a team player. <BR>  Beside the occasional group endeavors, Hulk has teamed-up with many others <BR> that didn't think he was so bad. Spider-Man, Power Man and Iron Fist have <BR> partnered with Hulk on several occasions. Even brutes like the Thing and <BR> scrappers like Wolverine identified with Hulk and have allied with him almost <BR>  as many times as they've fought against him. Not only has Hulk befriended those <BR>  in the super-hero community, but he has managed to form bonds with regular people <BR>  such as "Crackajack" Jackson and Jim Wilson. <BR> 
Unfortunately for the Hulk, there are many who used his limited intelligence against <BR>  him and attempted to manipulate him for their own selfish means. Vile menaces <BR>  like the Leader, Tyrannus, and Captain Omen. <BR>  When Hulk proved to be too hard to control, they sent their minions like <BR>  Aquon and Mogol to confront him physically. Enemies came in all shapes <BR>  and sizes, ranging in power levels. From mere humans like Devastator, to evolved <BR>  beings like the Inheritor, to monstrous powerhouses like Glob, Hulk <BR>  always found a way to prevail – even against those <BR>  who masqueraded as friends such as his old physics professor, <BR>  Geoffrey Crawford – later known as Ravage.  <BR><BR>
